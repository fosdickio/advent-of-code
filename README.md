This repository contains solutions in Go for the [Advent of Code 2020 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Project Structure
- `assets` directory - contains input text files for the puzzles
- `cmd` directory - contains executables for each puzzle day
- `docs` directory - contains instructions for each of the puzzles
- `pkg` directory - contains reusable library code used for each of the puzzles

## Requirements
- Go (1.15+)

## Instructions
You can then run executables for each of the individual days from the `cmd` directory.  See below for an example.
